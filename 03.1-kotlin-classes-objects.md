### Interfaces

- In kotlin, interfaces can contain declarations of an abstract method and a method with implementation.
- Interfaces can't store state whereas abstract classs can store state. This make both different.
- A class or object can implement one or more interfaces.
- Interface can also have properties. But these properties need to be abstract or a constant.
- Properties declared in interface can't have backing field, because the properties need to define custom implemention on the accessor of the property.
  ```
  interface MyInterface {
    val prop: Int // abstract

    val propertyWithImplementation: String
        get() = "foo"

    fun foo() {
        print(prop)
    }
  }

  class Child : MyInterface {
    override val prop: Int = 29
  }
  ```

#### Interfaces Inheritance
- An interfaces can be derived from other interfaces.
- classes implementing such an interface are only required to define the missing implementations.
  ```
  interface Named {
    val name: String
  }

  interface Person : Named {
    val firstName: String
    val lastName: String

    override val name: String get() = "$firstName $lastName"
  }

  data class Employee(
    // implementing 'name' is not required
    override val firstName: String,
    override val lastName: String,
    val position: Position
  ) : Person
  ```
- Abstract property define in interface can be overide inside the class body or a class constructor.

#### Resolving overriding conflicts
- When you declare many types in your supertype list, you may inherit more than one implementation of the same method.
  ```
  interface A {
    fun foo() { print("A") }
    fun bar()
  }

  interface B {
    fun foo() { print("B") }
    fun bar() { print("bar") }
  }

  class C : A {
      override fun bar() { print("bar") }
  }

  class D : A, B {
    override fun foo() {
        super<A>.foo()
        super<B>.foo()
    }

    override fun bar() {
        super<B>.bar()
    }
  }
  ```

### Functional Interface SAM
- An interface with only one abstract method is called functional interface or single abstract method interface.
- Functional interface can have several non abstract method.
- To declare a functional interface in Kotlin, use the `fun` modifier
  ```
  fun interface KRunnable {
   fun invoke()
  }
  ```
- For functional interfaces, you can use SAM conversions that help make your code more concise and readable by using lambda expressions.
  ```
  fun interface IntPredicate {
   fun accept(i: Int): Boolean
  }

  val isEven = IntPredicate { it % 2 == 0 }

  fun main() {
     println("Is 7 even? - ${isEven.accept(7)}")
  }
  ```
# Search on difference b/w Functional Interface or type aliases?

### Visibility modifiers
- Classes, objects, interfaces, constructors, and functions, as well as properties and their setters, can have visibility modifiers. Getters always have the same visibility as their properties.
- There are four visibility modifiers in Kotlin: `private`, `protected`, `internal`, and `public`. The default visibility is `public`.
- `private` modifier means that the declation inside a class is only available inside that class. For top level declarationn, this will be visible inside the file.
- `protected` declation only available in its class and subclass.
- `public` modifier means that the declarations are visible everywhere.
- 'internal' modifier means that the declatios are visible inside a module.

#### Packages
- Functions, properties, classes, objects, and interfaces can be declared at the "top-level" directly inside a package:
  ```
  // file name: example.kt
  package foo

  private fun foo() { ... } // visible inside example.kt

  public var bar: Int = 5 // property is visible everywhere
    private set         // setter is visible only in example.kt

  internal val baz = 6    // visible inside the same module
  ```
#### Class members
```
open class Outer {
    private val a = 1
    protected open val b = 2
    internal open val c = 3
    val d = 4  // public by default

    protected class Nested {
        public val e: Int = 5
    }
}

class Subclass : Outer() {
    // a is not visible
    // b, c and d are visible
    // Nested and e are visible

    override val b = 5   // 'b' is protected
    override val c = 7   // 'c' is internal
}

class Unrelated(o: Outer) {
    // o.a, o.b are not visible
    // o.c and o.d are visible (same module)
    // Outer.Nested is not visible, and Nested::e is not visible either
}
```
#### Constructors
- In order to add modifier in a constructor, a `constructor` keyword is reqiored.
  ```
  class C private constructor(a: Int) { ... }
  ```
- Here the constructor is private. By default, all constructors are public, which effectively amounts to them being visible everywhere the class is visible (this means that a constructor of an internal class is only visible within the same module).
