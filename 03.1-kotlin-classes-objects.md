### Interfaces

- In kotlin, interfaces can contain declarations of an abstract method and a method with implementation.
- Interfaces can't store state whereas abstract can store state. This make both difference.
- A class or object can implement one or more interfaces.
- Interface can also have properties. But these properties need to be abstract or a constant.
- Properties declared in interface can't have backing field, because the properties need to define custom implemention on the accessor of the property.
  ```
  interface MyInterface {
    val prop: Int // abstract

    val propertyWithImplementation: String
        get() = "foo"

    fun foo() {
        print(prop)
    }
  }

  class Child : MyInterface {
    override val prop: Int = 29
  }
  ```

#### Interfaces Inheritance
- An interfaces can be derived from other interfaces.
- classes implementing such an interface are only required to define the missing implementations.
  ```
  interface Named {
    val name: String
  }

  interface Person : Named {
    val firstName: String
    val lastName: String

    override val name: String get() = "$firstName $lastName"
  }

  data class Employee(
    // implementing 'name' is not required
    override val firstName: String,
    override val lastName: String,
    val position: Position
  ) : Person
  ```
- Abstract property define in interface can be overide inside the class body or a class constructor.

#### Resolving overriding conflicts
- When you declare many types in your supertype list, you may inherit more than one implementation of the same method.
  ```
  interface A {
    fun foo() { print("A") }
    fun bar()
  }

  interface B {
    fun foo() { print("B") }
    fun bar() { print("bar") }
  }

  class C : A {
      override fun bar() { print("bar") }
  }

  class D : A, B {
    override fun foo() {
        super<A>.foo()
        super<B>.foo()
    }

    override fun bar() {
        super<B>.bar()
    }
  }
  ```
